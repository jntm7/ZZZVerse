After obtaining Polar, Hoshimi Miyabi will automatically draw her blade and unleash powerful slashes based on the current charge level upon consuming Fallen Frost. Before Fallen Frost is completely depleted, the draw and slashes will not interrupt charging under Shimotsuki Stance. Each occurrence of Shimotsuki Stance can perform up to 3 draws and slashes.",
